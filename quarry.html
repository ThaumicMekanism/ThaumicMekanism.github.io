<h1>The Crypto Quarry (WIP)</h1>
<p>This is a lightweight page to optimize performance. This is going to be the place to mine while you browse! Join the quarry! :D</p>
<p>This will just be a hub to go to the different mineshafts. <br>
This file will not be a mineshaft but just help create your settings and redirect you to the area of the quarry you want to reap off of.</p>
